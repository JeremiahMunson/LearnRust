        <h1>Rust Basics</h1>
        <p>
            This is just the basics of Rust in condensed form.
            More detail is covered in the book found <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">here</a>.
            This is just because there was too much non-code material to nicely include in example programs alone.
