        <h1>Rust Basics</h1>
        <p>
            This is just the basics of Rust in condensed form.
            More detail is covered in the book found <a target="blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">here</a>.
            This is just because there was too much non-code material to nicely include in example programs alone.

        <h2>Common Programming Concepts</h2>
        <h3>Variables and Mutability</h3>

        <p>
            To declare a variable we use the keyword <span class="code"><code>let</code></span>. 
            This creates a new, immutable variable which means the value of the variable cannot be changed.
            This is not the same as <span class="code"><code>const</code></span> which declares a constant.
            A constant must be annotated (type explicity written) while variables usually don't need to.
            Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, making them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.
            Constants must also be set only to a constant expression whereas a variable can be set as the result of a function call or any other value that can only be computed at runtime.
            You can declare a mutable variable by doing <span class="code"><code>let mut</code></span>, but you can't make an immutable variable mutable.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can shadow a variable by declaring a variable with the same name.
            This allows you to change the value and even the type of a variable you have already declared.
            For example, let's say you declare a variable <span class="code"><code>let x = 5;</code></span> and now you want a variable called <span class="code"><code>x</code></span> that holds a string.
            If you don't need the current variable, you can shadow it by declaring the variable again (<span class="code"><code>let mut x = String::new();</code></span>).

        </p>
